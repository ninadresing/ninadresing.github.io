 abstract = {The two STEREO spacecraft, in combination with near-Earth observatories (SOHO, ACE, and WIND) provide three well separated viewpoints, which are best suited to investigate solar energetic particle (SEP) events and their longitudinal dependences. Requesting a minimum longitudinal separation angle of 80 degrees between the source active region at the Sun and the magnetic footpoint of one spacecraft observing the event we find 19 wide-spread events which were observed at least by two spacecraft in the years from 2009 to 2012. We investigate the events in a statistical manner in terms of maximum intensities, onset delays, rise times, anisotropies and correlation to other phenomena like CMEs or type II radio bursts to shed some light on the physical processes yielding such extremely large angular particle distributions. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Fisica.
