 abstract = {The Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT) aboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) is designed to provide the three-dimensional distribution of energetic electrons and protons with good energy and time resolution. Each SEPT instrument consists of two double-ended magnet–foil particle telescopes which cleanly separate and measure electrons in the energy range from 30 keV to 400 keV and protons from 60 keV to 7000 keV. Anisotropy information on a non-spinning spacecraft is provided by two separate but identical instruments: SEPT-E aligned along the Parker spiral magnetic field in the ecliptic plane looking both towards and away from the Sun, and SEPT-NS aligned vertical to the ecliptic plane looking towards North and South. The dual set-up refers to two adjacent sensor apertures for each of the four viewing directions SUN, ANTISUN, NORTH, and SOUTH: one for protons, one for electrons. In this contribution a simulation of SEPT utilizing the GEANT4 toolkit has been set up with an extended instrument model in order to calculate improved response functions of the four different telescopes. Here we applied these response functions to quiet-time periods during the minimum between Solar Cycles 23 and 24 (SC-23 and SC-24) when the flux of ions above 10 MeV is dominated by galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The corresponding spectra are determined by a force-field approximation and used as input for our calculation, leading to good agreement of the computed ion count rates with measurements of SEPT above 400 keV. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},
