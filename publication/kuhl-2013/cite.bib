 abstract = {The electron intensities in the energy range from a few hundred keV to a few tens of MeV in the inner heliosphere are determined by the intensities of Jovian and galactic cosmic ray electrons, with sporadic intensity increases of solar origin. In contrast to galactic cosmic rays, Jovian electrons are emitted from a point source (on the considered scale). Thus the magnetic connection of the planet to an observer close to the Earth as well as parallel and perpendicular diffusion of these electrons is of major importance to understand the measured intensity variations. Here we discuss these variations by analysing the electron intensity near Earth measured by SOHO/EPHIN as a function of the Earths position with respect to Jupiter. Electron spectra for time series in which Jovian electrons can reach the Earth by perpendicular diffusion only and mainly by parallel diffusion are presented. By comparing these different spectra we can estimate an upper limit for the galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum in the energy range from a few hundred keV to about 10 MeV. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Fisica.
