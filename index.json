The event was the second widespread SEP event of solar cycle 25 and produced relativistic electrons and protons. It was associated with a long-lasting solar hard X-ray flare showing multiple hard X-ray peaks over a duration of one hour. The event was further accompanied by a medium fast Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) with a speed of 880 km s −1 driving a shock, an EUV wave as well as long-lasting and complex radio burst activity showing four distinct type III burst groups over a period of 40 minutes. *Aims.* We aim at understanding the reason for the wide SEP spread as well as identifying the underlying source regions of the electron and proton event. *Methods.* A comprehensive multi-spacecraft analysis of remote-sensing observations and in-situ measurements of the energetic particles and interplanetary context is applied to attribute the SEP observations at the different locations to the various potential source regions at the Sun. An ENLIL simulation is used to characterize the complex interplanetary state and its role for the energetic particle transport. The magnetic connection between the spacecraft and the Sun is determined using ballistic backmapping in combination with potential field source surface extrapolations in the lower corona. In combination with a reconstruction of the coronal shock front we then determine the times when the shock establishes magnetic connections with the different observers. Radio observations are used to characterize the directivity of the four main injection episodes, which are then employed in a 2D SEP transport simulation to test the importance of these different injection episodes. *Results.* A comprehensive timing analysis of the inferred solar injection times of the SEPs observed at the different spacecraft suggests different source processes being important for the electron and the proton event. Comparison with characteristics and timing of the potential sources, such as the CME-driven shock or the flare, suggests a stronger shock contribution for the proton event and a more likely flare-related source of the electron event. *Conclusions.* Different to earlier studies on widespread SEP events, we find that in this event an important ingredient for the wide SEP spread was the wide longitudinal range of about 110◦ covered by distinct SEP injections, which is also supported by our SEP transport modeling.","tags":null,"title":"The 17 April 2021 widespread solar energetic particle event","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Immanuel Christopher Jebaraj","Athanasios Koulooumvakos","Nina Dresing","Alexander Warmuth","Nicolas Wijsen","Christian Palmroos","Jan Gieseler","Rami Vainio","Vratislav Krupar","Jasmina Magdalenic","Thomas Wiegelmann","Frederic Schuller","Andrea Battaglia","Annamaria Fedeli"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673960080,"objectID":"ed422126512eb1bb3980ad31462ab980","permalink":"http://ninadresing.github.io/publication/2023-ar-xiv-230103650-j/","publishdate":"2023-01-17T12:54:40.488036Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-ar-xiv-230103650-j/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Multiple injections of energetic electrons associated with the flare/CME event on 9 October 2021","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

This modeling technique provides also shock properties in the specific shock regions that are magnetically connected to the two STEREO spacecraft.

We find that pitch-angle scattering can lead to spectral changes at higher energies (E 100 keV) and further away from the Sun (r 1 au) which are also often observed. At lower energies, and closer to the Sun the effect of pitch-angle scattering is much reduced so that the simulated energy spectra still resemble the injected power-law functions. When examining pitch-angle dependent spectra, we find, in agreement with the observational results, that the spectra of the backward propagating electrons are harder than that of the forward (from the Sun) propagating population.

They are connected to solar active regions and flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), EUV waves, shocks, Type II and III radio emissions, and X-ray bursts. These phenomena are major probes of the partition of energy in solar eruptions, as well as for the organization, dynamics, and relaxation of coronal and interplanetary magnetic fields. Many of these phenomena cause terrestrial space weather, posing multiple hazards for humans and their technology from space to the ground. Since particular flares, shocks, CMEs, and EUV waves produce SEP events but others do not, since propagation effects from the low corona to 1 AU appear important for some events but not others, and since Type II and III radio emissions and X-ray bursts are sometimes produced by energetic particles leaving these acceleration sites, it is necessary to study the whole system with a multi-frequency and multi-instrument perspective that combines both in-situ and remote observations with detailed modelling of phenomena. This article demonstrates this comprehensive approach, and shows its necessity, by analysing a trio of unusual and striking solar eruptions, radio and X-ray bursts, and SEP events that occurred on 4 November 2015. These events show both strong similarities and differences from standard events and each other, despite having very similar interplanetary conditions and only two are sites and CME genesis regions. They are therefore major targets for further in-depth observational studies, and for testing both existing and new theories and models. Based on the very limited modelling available we identify the aspects that are and are not understood, and we discuss ideas that may lead to improved understanding of the SEP, radio, and space-weather events.","tags":null,"title":"Comprehensive Characterization of Solar Eruptions With Remote and In-Situ Observations, and Modeling: The Major Solar Events on 4 November 2015","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

We make use of proton data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron Experiment (SOHO/ERNE) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory/High Energy Telescopes (STEREO/HET), together with electron data from the Advanced Composition Explorer/Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (ACE/EPAM) and the STEREO/Solar Electron and Proton Telescopes (SEPT). We consider soft X-ray data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and coronal mass ejection (CME) observations made with the SOHO/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) and STEREO/Coronagraphs 1 and 2 (COR1, COR2) to establish the probable associations between SEP events and the related solar phenomena. Event onset times and peak intensities are determined; velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) and time-shifting analysis (TSA) are performed for protons; TSA is performed for electrons. In our event sample, there is a tendency for the highest peak intensities to occur when the observer is magnetically connected to solar regions west of the flare. Our estimates for the mean event width, derived as the standard deviation of a Gaussian curve modelling the SEP intensities (protons ≈44∘, electrons ≈50∘), largely agree with previous results for lower-energy SEPs. SEP release times with respect to event flares, as well as the event rise times, show no simple dependence on the observer’s connection angle, suggesting that the source region extent and dominant particle acceleration and transport mechanisms are important in defining these characteristics of an event.

Interplanetary (IP) shocks are known to be accelerators of energetic charged particles observed in-situ in the heliosphere. However, the acceleration of near-relativistic electrons by shocks in the interplanetary medium is often questioned. On 9 August 2011 a corotating interaction region (CIR) passed STEREO B (STB), which resulted in a flux increase in the electron and ion channels of the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT). Because electron measurements in the few keV to several 100 keV range rely on the so-called magnet foil technique, which is utilized by SEPT, ions can contribute to the electron channels. Aim. We aim to investigate whether the flux increase in the electron channels of SEPT during the CIR event on 9 August 2011 is caused by ion contamination only. Methods. We compute the SEPT response functions for protons and helium utilizing an updated GEANT4 model of SEPT. The CIR energetic particle ion spectra for protons and helium are assumed to follow a Band function in energy per nucleon with a constant helium to proton ratio. Results. Our analysis leads to a helium to proton ratio of 16.9% and a proton flux following a Band function with the parameters I0 = 1.24 × 104 (cm2 s sr MeV nuc-1)-1, Ec = 79 keV nuc-1, and spectral indices of γ1 = -0.94 and γ2 = -3.80, which are in good agreement with measurements by the Suprathermal Ion Telescope (SIT) aboard STB.

The main sources of solar energetic particle (SEP) events are solar flares and shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While it is generally accepted that energetic protons can be accelerated by shocks, whether or not these shocks can also efficiently accelerate solar energetic electrons is still debated. In this study we present observations of the extremely widespread SEP event of 26 Dec 2013 To the knowledge of the authors, this is the widest longitudinal SEP distribution ever observed together with unusually long-lasting energetic electron anisotropies at all observer positions. Further striking features of the event are long-lasting SEP intensity increases, two distinct SEP components with the second component mainly consisting of high-energy particles, a complex associated coronal activity including a pronounced signature of a shock in radio type-II observations, and the interaction of two CMEs early in the event. Aims. The observations require a prolonged injection scenario not only for protons but also for electrons. We therefore analyze the data comprehensively to characterize the possible role of the shock for the electron event. Methods. Remote-sensing observations of the complex solar activity are combined with in situ measurements of the particle event. We also apply a graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model to the coronagraph observations of the two associated CMEs to analyze their interaction. Results. We find that the shock alone is likely not responsible for this extremely wide SEP event. Therefore we propose a scenario of trapped energetic particles inside the CME-CME interaction region which undergo further acceleration due to the shock propagating through this region, stochastic acceleration, or ongoing reconnection processes inside the interaction region. The origin of the second component of the SEP event is likely caused by a sudden opening of the particle trap. © ESO 2018.","tags":null,"title":"Long-lasting injection of solar energetic electrons into the heliosphere","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

The impulsive electron events were associated with recurrent flare and jet (hereafter flare/jet) activity at the border of an isolated coronal hole situated close to the solar equator. We have focused our study on the solar energetic particle (SEP) event on 17 July 2014, during which both spacecraft detected a similar impulsive and anisotropic energetic electron event suggesting optimal connection of both spacecraft to the parent particle source, despite the large angular separation between the parent flare and the nominal magnetic footpoints on the source surface of STA and STB of 68° and 90°, respectively. Combining the remote-sensing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, in-situ plasma, magnetic field, and energetic particle data we investigated and discuss here the origin and the propagation trajectory of energetic electrons in the solar corona. We find that the energetic electrons in the energy range of 55-195 keV together with the associated EUV jet were injected from the flare site toward the spacecraft's magnetic footpoints and propagate along a strongly non-radial and inclined magnetic field below the source surface. From stereoscopic (EUV) observations we estimated the inclination angle of the jet trajectory and the respective magnetic field of 63° ± 11° relative to the radial direction. We show how the flare accelerated electrons reach very distant longitudes in the heliosphere, when the spacecraft are nominally not connected to the particle source. This example illustrates how ballistic backmapping can occasionally fail to characterize the magnetic connectivity during SEP events. This finding also provides an additional mechanism (one among others), which may explain the origin of widespread SEP events. © 2018 ESO.","tags":null,"title":"Strong non-radial propagation of energetic electrons in solar corona","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

We address this issue by simulating SEP electron propagation using a spatially 2D transport model that includes perpendicular diffusion. By implementing, as far as possible, the most reasonable estimates of the transport (diffusion) coefficients, we compare our results, in a qualitative manner, to recent observations at energies of 55105 keV, focusing on the longitudinal distribution of the peak intensity, the maximum anisotropy, and the onset time. By using transport coefficients that are derived from first principles, we limit the number of free parameters in the model to (i) the probability of SEPs following diffusing magnetic field lines, quantified by a [0, 1], and (ii) the broadness of the Gaussian injection function. It is found that the model solutions are extremely sensitive to the magnitude of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient and relatively insensitive to the form of the injection function as long as a reasonable value of a0.2 is used. We illustrate the effects of perpendicular diffusion on the model solutions and discuss the viability of this process as a dominant mechanism by which SEPs are transported in longitude. Lastly, we try to quantity the effectiveness of perpendicular diffusion as an interplay between the magnitude of the relevant diffusion coefficient and the SEP intensity gradient driving the diffusion process. It follows that perpendicular diffusion is extremely effective early in an SEP event when large intensity gradients are present, while the effectiveness quickly decreases with time thereafter. © 2017.

Each of the two Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft carries a Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT) which measures electrons and protons. Anisotropy observations are provided in four viewing directions: along the nominal magnetic field Parker spiral in the ecliptic towards the Sun (SUN) and away from the Sun (Anti-Sun/ASUN), and towards the north (NORTH) and south (SOUTH). The solar energetic particle (SEP) event on 7 November 2013 was observed by both STEREO spacecraft, which were longitudinally separated by 68° at that time. While STEREO A observed the expected characteristics of an SEP event at a well-connected position, STEREO B detected a very anisotropic bi-directional distribution of near-relativistic electrons and was situated inside a magnetic-cloud-like structure during the early phase of the event. Aims. We examine the source of the bi-directional SEP distribution at STEREO B. On the one hand this distribution could be caused by a double injection into both loop legs of the magnetic cloud (MC). On the other hand, a mirroring scenario where the incident beam is reflected in the opposite loop leg could be the reason. Furthermore, the energetic electron observations are used to probe the magnetic structure inside the magnetic cloud. Methods. We investigate in situ plasma and magnetic field observations and show that STEREO B was embedded in an MC-like structure ejected three days earlier on 4 November from the same active region. We apply a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to the coronagraph observations from three viewpoints as well as the Global Magnetic Cloud (GMC) model to the in situ measurements at STEREO B to determine the orientation and topology of the MC close to the Sun and at 1 AU. We also estimate the path lengths of the electrons propagating through the MC to estimate the amount of magnetic field line winding inside the structure. Results. The relative intensity and timing of the energetic electron increases in the different SEPT telescopes at STEREO B strongly suggest that the bi-directional electron distribution is formed by SEP injections in both loop legs of the MC separately instead of by mirroring farther away beyond the STEREO orbit. Observations by the Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH) of two distinct radio sources during the SEP injection further support the above scenario. The determined electron path lengths are around 50% longer than the estimated lengths of the loop legs of the MC itself (based on the GCS model) suggesting that the amount of field line winding is moderate. © ESO, 2016.","tags":null,"title":"Injection of solar energetic particles into both loop legs of a magnetic cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

At this time the longitudinal separation angle between STEREO-A (STA) and STEREO-B (STB) was less than 72. The parent particlesources (flares) of the four investigated events were situated close to, in between, or to the west of the STEREO's magnetic footpoints. The STEREO measurements revealed a strong difference in electron peak intensities (factor 12) showing unexpected intensity distributions at 1 AU, although the two spacecraft had nominally nearly the same angular magnetic footpoint separation from the flaring active region (AR) or their magnetic footpoints were both situated eastwards from the parent particle source. Furthermore, the events detected by the two STEREO imply a strongly unexpected onset timing with respect to each other: the spacecraft magnetically best connected to the flare detected a later arrival of electrons than the other one.

All previous studied events were only observed by a single spacecraft (s/c). For the first time, we present measurements of this kind of an electron spike event that was observed simultaneously by both close-spaced STEREO s/c on 2 May 2014. The longitudinal separation angle between STEREO-A (STA) and STEREO-B (STB) was 38°. The spikes at STA and STB are characterized by very short durations of ≤12 min at full-width at half maximum (FWHM) and almost identical and symmetric time profiles. They exhibit similar properties in durations, pitch angle distributions (PADs), energy spectra, and peak intensities. The spike parent source was situated close to the STA nominal magnetic footpoint and was separated by 48° from STB's footpoint. The intensity distribution and the relative onset timing behaved opposite to what is expected: STB measured a higher intensity and an earlier onset than the nominally better connected STA. We suggest that the spike electrons undergo a substantial nonradial injection into interplanetary (IP) space from the parent source, a flaring active region (AR), and propagate in a strong nonradial diverging magnetic field. In addition we show that because of the spike properties it is evident that, irrespective of how the electrons were injected into the IP medium, the en route particle scattering conditions along the paths to STA and STB were very similar.

In February 2011, the two STEREO spacecrafts reached a separation of 180 degrees in longitude, offering a complete view of the Sun for the first time ever. When the full Sun surface is visible, source active regions of solar energetic particle (SEP) events can be identified unambiguously. STEREO, in combination with near-Earth observatories such as ACE or SOHO, provides three well separated viewpoints, which build an unprecedented platform from which to investigate the longitudinal variations of SEP events. Aims. We show an ensemble of SEP events that were observed between 2009 and mid-2013 by at least two spacecrafts and show a remarkably wide particle spread in longitude (wide-spread events). The main selection criterion for these events was a longitudinal separation of at least 80 degrees between active region and spacecraft magnetic footpoint for the widest separated spacecraft. We investigate the events statistically in terms of peak intensities, onset delays, and rise times, and determine the spread of the longitudinal events, which is the range filled by SEPs during the events. Energetic electron anisotropies are investigated to distinguish the source and transport mechanisms that lead to the observed wide particle spreads. Methods. According to the anisotropy distributions, we divided the events into three classes depending on different source and transport scenarios. One potential mechanism for wide-spread events is efficient perpendicular transport in the interplanetary medium that competes with another scenario, which is a wide particle spread that occurs close to the Sun. In the latter case, the observations at 1 AU during the early phase of the events are expected to show significant anisotropies because of the wide injection range at the Sun and particle-focusing during the outward propagation, while in the first case only low anisotropies are anticipated. Results. We find events for both of these scenarios in our sample that match the expected observations and even different events that do not agree with the scenarios. We conclude that probably both an extended source region at the Sun and perpendicular transport in the interplanetary medium are involved for most of these wide-spread events. © ESO, 2014.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical survey of widely spread out solar electron events observed with STEREO and ACE with special attention to anisotropies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

We use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light coronagraph observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory, and the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B) to determine the angular extent of the EUV wave and coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the origin of the SEP event. We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each spacecraft with the arrival time of the structures associated with the CME at the footpoints of the field lines connecting each spacecraft with the Sun. Whereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock at the footpoint of STEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the particles observed by this spacecraft, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint of the field lines connecting near-Earth observers with the Sun, even though an intense SEP event was observed there. We show that the west flank of the CME-driven shock propagating at high altitudes above the solar surface was most likely the source of the particles observed near Earth, but it did not leave any EUV trace on the solar disk. We conclude that the angular extent of the EUV wave on the solar surface did not agree with the longitudinal extent of the SEP event in the heliosphere. Hence EUV waves cannot be used reliably as a proxy for the solar phenomenon that accelerates and injects energetic particles over broad ranges of longitudes. © 2014.

This event has been largely studied because of its peculiar initiation and its possible forecasting consequences for space weather. We show an in situ analysis (on days June 6th-7th of 2008) of the CME in the interplanetary medium in order to shed some light on the propagation and evolution mechanisms of the interplanetary CME (ICME). The goals of this work are twofold: gathering the whole in situ data from PLASTIC and IMPACT onboard STEREO B in order to provide a complete characterization of the ICME, and to present a model where the thermal plasma pressure is included. The isolated ICME features show a clear forward shock which we identify as an oblique forward fast shock accelerating ions to a few-hundred keV during its passage. Following the shock, a flux rope is easily defined as a magnetic cloud (MC) by the magnetic field components and magnitude, and the low proton plasma-Β. During the spacecraft passage through the MC, the energetic ion intensity shows a pronounced decrease, suggesting a closed magnetic topology, and the suprathermal electron population shows a density and temperature increase, demonstrating the importance of the electrons in the MC description. The in situ evidence suggests that there is no direct magnetic connection between the forward shock and the MC, and the characteristics of the reverse shock determined suggest that the shock pair is a consequence of the propagation of the ICME in the interplanetary medium. The energetic ions measured by the SEPT instrument suggest that their enhancement is not related to any solar event, but is solely due to the interplanetary shock consistent with the fact that no flares are observed on the Sun. The changes in the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field in the vicinity of the ICME observed by electron PADs from SWEA are in accordance with the idea that the CME originated along a neutral line over the quiet Sun.The magnetic cloud model presented in this work provides the plasma pressure as a new factor to consider in the study of the expansion and evolution of CMEs in the interplanetary medium. This model could provide a new understanding of the Sun-Earth connection because of the important role that the plasma plays in the eruption of the CME in the solar corona and the reconnection process carried out with the Earth's magnetosphere. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis and study of the in situ observation of the June 1st 2008 CME by STEREO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

Therefore we concentrate on the two CIR events from day 5 to day 10 of August 2007 and from day 25 to day 31 of August 2007, which lend themselves to a more undisturbed comparison. Using the multi-spacecraft measurements we could determine a radial gradient of 230±30% AU-1, which is consistent with previous results by van Hollebeke et al. (J. Geophys. Res. 83, 4723, 1978) of -350% AU-1 using Helios and Pioneer data. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-spacecraft observations of CIR-associated ion increases during the ulysses 2007 ecliptic crossing","type":"publication"}]
